# WS Next boiler - with TS

A simple NextJS boilerplate with Axios.

Added Material UI as there's little styling (the global.css is generic)

## Features

- Next.js: A React.js framework that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and generating static websites for React based web applications.
- Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.

## Getting Started

Navigate into the directory and install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.


No test files as yet - hopefully I'll get the chance to add some Cypress before this morning's meeting...
